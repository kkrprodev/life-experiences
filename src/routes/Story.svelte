I am Krishnakumar, working as software developer in a private company. Here, I am sharing my laptop service experience with Palies IT Service in Coimbatore. 
Since first week of March 2023, I had been facing an issue with the display of my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop – display quality is reduced and sometimes purple/pink tint will appear and disappear. 
No cracks and No dead pixels.
Like most people, I googled the symptoms and found that this could be display driver issue. 
I tried to update the display driver but it was already up-to-date. Then, I changed the OS from Windows to Ubuntu but again I faced exactly the same issue. Wihout confusion, I believed it must be hardware issue.
So, I opened the laptop back panel, unplugged and plugged the display cable. It brought back the display to perfectly normal condition.
I was very happy but it lasted for around 15 minutes. Again, the same issue reappeared. I thought it must be display cable connectivity issue.
At this time, I already had a plan to visit my sister's home in Coimbatore. So, I decided to service my laptop in Coimbatore rather than in my native.
<br/>
</p>

<h3> What happened before 10-Apr-2023?</h3>

<p>
I arrived at Coimbatore on 07-Apr-2023 (Friday). After breakfast, I went to laptop service center at 100 feet road, Coimbatore and explained the problem & 
specifically asked them to test the display cable at first. When I revisit On 09-Apr-2023 (Sunday), they told that when they change display cable, the display is working fine
but they need 1 or 2 days time to test it regressively. Since I had my return train Sunday night, I collected my laptop without fixing. 
Late evening, my brother-in-law asked to leave the laptop with him so that he would get it fixed from nearby service center. I departed to my native.
The laptop was in same condition from first week of March to 09-Apr-2023.
</p>


<h3> What happened on 10-Apr-2023 and 11-Apr-2023?</h3>

<p>
My brother-in-law gave my laptop to a laptop service center – Palies IT Services, Standard towers, Avinashi road , Peelamedu, Coimbatore 641004 – on 10-Apr-2023.
They provided an acknowledgement slip, created a temporary WhatsApp group to post updates and progress. 
They posted acknowledgement slip, photos of my laptop (hardware and display) at the time of acceptance in the WhatsApp group.
After investigation and testing, they had posted their estimation/cost of replacements/services needed for my laptop in the WhatsApp group on 11-Apr-2023 01:30 PM as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Replacement needed
		<ul><li> Display – 4000 + Tax (1 Year Warranty) </li></ul>
	</li>
	<li> Suggested upgrades
		<ul><li> Vacuum Cleaning – 600 + Tax </li>
		<li> Heat Sink Paste Replacement – 350 + Tax </li>
		<li> McAfee AntiVirus – 500 + Tax (1 Year Subscription) </li>
		<li> Cleaning Kid – 200 </li></ul>
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, the service engineer called me and told that the display must be changed. He asked my approval to replace the display on 11-Apr-2023 06:30 PM 
but I denied because my intuition and the comments I got from previous service center made me believe that it could be display cable issue and could be fixed with little cost. 
</p>

<h3> What happened on 12-Apr-2023?</h3>

<p>
I asked my brother-in-law to collect it from Palies since I was in native at that time.
He collected the laptop back at 12-Apr-2023 04:00 PM and went back home. 
After reaching home, he opened the laptop and was shocked by seeing the condition of the display.
Some portion of the screen were totally black, exist a small crack in the display and display was not properly fitted back after they completed testing. 
He informed me and I informed them immediately at 06:00 PM. 
The receptionist attended the phone and assured me that the service engineer left office and she would connect me with the service executive the next day.

</p>

<h3> The Great Response </h3>

Service engineer called me on 13-Apr-2023 and the argument started. 
He told that when he removed the display and put it in the test laptop, the display came to this condition by itself.
He never acknowledged that it was happened due to his improper handling of the display.
Without any business ethics, they told that you have to change your display at your own cost since it wasn't their fault.

I got extremely angered that when he irrelevantly told that Palies IT Service had delivered your laptop at 12-Apr-2023 4PM and 
you informed us the issue at 6PM. So, within this 2 hours gap, I should've damaged my own laptop.
<br/><br/>
Finally after 2 weeks of arguments, the service engineer gave the manager contact number. When I spoke with him, he is even more irresponsible and blamed me that 
I should have tested my laptop at 04:00 PM and hence it's not Palies IT Serice's fault. When I asked to meet with him directly, 
he told that he will call me when he reaches office but no response for 15 days. When I spoke with receptionist on 15-May-2023, she told that Manager is in hospital and
will call back when he returns. Till today 21-May-2023, no response. They 're group of liars, don't know what's customer satisfaction but running a business.

My argunment was simple, I asked to return my laptop in the same condition when it was submitted to them. It remained in same state for more than a month before I handed over to Palies.
The service engineer is already aware that this has happened while testing but when we collected the laptop, he purposefully remained silent and never spoke a word about this problem.
They are not ready to compensate with single rupee. They are running business without ethics and scrapping customer's hard earned money. 
These inexperienced, irresponsible costed me of Rs. 15,000 for the new display.

NEVER, EVER GO TO PALIES, IT SERVICE, COIMBATORE.
