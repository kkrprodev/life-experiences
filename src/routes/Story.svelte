I am Krishnakumar, working as software developer in a private company. Here, I am sharing my laptop service experience with Palies IT Service in Coimbatore. 
I have a HP laptop (Model: HP Pavilion Gaming 15-ec0026ax)
I had been facing an issue for about a month with the display of my laptop â€“ display quality is reduced and sometimes purple/pink tint will appear and disappear. No cracks and No dead pixels.
Like most people, I googled the symptoms and found that this could be display driver issue. Hence, I tried to update my driver but it was already up-to-date. 
Then, I changed the OS from Windows to Ubuntu but again I faced exactly the same issue. Wihout confusion, I believed it must be hardware issue.
I opened the laptop back panel, unplugged and plugged the display cable. It brought back the display to perfectly normal condition.
I was very happy but it lasted for around 15 minutes. Again, the same issue reappeared.
At this time, I already had a plan to visit my sister's home in Coimbatore that would be in 10 days. So, I decided to service my laptop in Coimbatore.
