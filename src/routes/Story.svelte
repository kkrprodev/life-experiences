I am Krishnakumar, working as software developer in a private company. Here, I am sharing my laptop service experience with Palies IT Service in Coimbatore. 
I have a HP laptop (Model: HP Pavilion Gaming 15-ec0026ax)
I had been facing an issue for about a month with the display of my laptop – display quality is reduced and sometimes purple/pink tint will appear and disappear. No cracks and No dead pixels.
Like most people, I googled the symptoms and found that this could be display driver issue. Hence, I tried to update my driver but it was already up-to-date. 
Then, I changed the OS from Windows to Ubuntu but again I faced exactly the same issue. Wihout confusion, I believed it must be hardware issue.
I opened the laptop back panel, unplugged and plugged the display cable. It brought back the display to perfectly normal condition.
I was very happy but it lasted for around 15 minutes. Again, the same issue reappeared.
At this time, I already had a plan to visit my sister's home in Coimbatore that would be in 10 days. So, I decided to service my laptop in Coimbatore.
My brother-in-law gave my laptop to a laptop service center – Palies IT Services, Standard towers, Avinashi road , Peelamedu, Coimbatore 641004 – on 10-Apr-2023.
They issued an acknowledgement slip to us.
They had created a temporary WhatsApp group to post updates and progress. They posted acknowledgement slip, photos of my laptop (hardware and display) at the time of acceptance.
<br/>
After investigation and testing, they had posted their estimation/cost of replacements/services needed for my laptop in the WhatsApp group on 11-Apr-2023 01:30 PM as follows:
Replacement needed
Display – 4000 + Tax (1 Year Warranty)
Suggested upgrades
Vacuum Cleaning – 600 + Tax
Heat Sink Paste Replacement – 350 + Tax
McAfee AntiVirus – 500 + Tax (1 Year Subscription)
Cleaning Kid – 200
