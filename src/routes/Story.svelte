I am Krishnakumar, working as software developer in a private company. Here, I am sharing my laptop service experience with Palies IT Service in Coimbatore. 
I had been facing an issue with the display of my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop – display quality is reduced and sometimes purple/pink tint will appear and disappear. No cracks and No dead pixels.
Like most people, I googled the symptoms and found that this could be display driver issue. 
I tried to update my display driver but it was already up-to-date. Then, I changed the OS from Windows to Ubuntu but again I faced exactly the same issue. Wihout confusion, I believed it must be hardware issue.
So, I opened the laptop back panel, unplugged and plugged the display cable. It brought back the display to perfectly normal condition.
I was very happy but it lasted for around 15 minutes. Again, the same issue reappeared.
At this time, I already had a plan to visit my sister's home in Coimbatore. So, I decided to service my laptop in Coimbatore rather than in my native.

<p>
My brother-in-law gave my laptop to a laptop service center – Palies IT Services, Standard towers, Avinashi road , Peelamedu, Coimbatore 641004 – on 10-Apr-2023.
They provided an acknowledgement slip, created a temporary WhatsApp group to post updates and progress. 
They posted acknowledgement slip, photos of my laptop (hardware and display) at the time of acceptance in the WhatsApp group.
<br/>
After investigation and testing, they had posted their estimation/cost of replacements/services needed for my laptop in the WhatsApp group on 11-Apr-2023 01:30 PM as follows:
Replacement needed
Display – 4000 + Tax (1 Year Warranty)
Suggested upgrades
Vacuum Cleaning – 600 + Tax
Heat Sink Paste Replacement – 350 + Tax
McAfee AntiVirus – 500 + Tax (1 Year Subscription)
Cleaning Kid – 200

The service engineer called me and told that the display must be changed.
I believed it should be display cable connectivity issue and so decided to fix it later. Since I was in native at that time, I asked my brother-in-law to collect it from Palies. 
He collected at 4PM and went back home. He opened the laptop and was shocked by seeing the condition of the display.
Some portion of the screen were totally black, exist a small crack in the display and display was not properly fitted back after they completed testing. 
He informed me and we informed them immediately (around 6PM).
Their receptionist informed us that the service engineer left office and assured call back the next day.
We got a call and had a tough argument. They never acknowledged that it was happened due to improper handling of the display by service engineer. 
They simply said the display came to this condition by itself. They take zero responsibility.
Without any business ethics, they told that you have to change your display at your own cost since it wasn't their fault.

They also told that we had delivered your laptop at 4PM and you informed us at 6PM so within this 2 hours gap, I should've damaged my laptop.
